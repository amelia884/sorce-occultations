REU 2021 project: Atmospheric Scale-Height via Solar Occultations measured by SORCE

Solar occultations provide a glimpse into the vertical structure of the atmosphere by inferring atmospheric properties from the extinction of Sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere.  The goal of this project is to analyze solar occultation data in order to derive scale heights for various atmospheric species.  The data that we will use was collected over 17 years by the XUV Photometer System (XPS) and SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) instruments that flew and operated aboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft.  On each orbit, as the spacecraft emerged from eclipse, Sun light is occulted by the Earth’s atmosphere allowing for atmospheric density profiles to be measured.

This project will analyze data from the Lyman-alpha channel of the SORCE XPS instrument and to plot occultation profiles of the Earth’s atmosphere in order to examine and understand the scale heights of atmospheric species.  We will also compare these occultations to similar measurements from the SORCE SOSLTICE instrument which has a much higher spectral resolution.  This project has the added potential to provide an understanding of the atmospheric attenuation of the Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) as a function of solar cycle variability.
